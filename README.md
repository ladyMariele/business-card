# Business-Card

## Description
Welcome Devs :) This is my very first project built with React, given as a challenge by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll)'s [Scrimba Course: Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). 
It is a static website that displays a common business card 

## Let's learn together
I'm a self-taught dev and I would love to make projects and learn good coding practices with other devs like you :) In this project I faced a little problem with making the page responsive (although it's not part of the challenge) to any screen devices (as i coded this with scrimba and not in my local editor). So apologies to mobile users if you're having trouble viewing this website 😁 

So to bored CSS gods out there, feel free to dissect this project :>
