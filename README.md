# Business-Card

## Description
Welcome Devs :) This is my very first project built with React, given as a challenge by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll)'s [Scrimba Course: Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). 
It is a static website that displays my business card.

## Let's learn together
I'm a self-taught dev and I would love to make projects and learn good coding practices with other devs like you.
